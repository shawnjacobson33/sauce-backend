Goals:
-
- Build internal automated systems to extract betting lines from a wide array of traditional sportsbooks and pickem/dfs sites for 
every market and league available, I will never pay for an API to get betting lines like most other
sports betting tools do.
- Train an ML model to learn complex patterns using features within the domain of a top-down strategy (finding
the bookmakers who have the sharpest odds, historical line movement, etc.), which results in
calculating an "expected value" for each betting line. 
- Create an engaging, attention-grasping, attractive user-interface that enables even the most
casual bettor to understand and enjoy gaining an edge over all bookmakers.
- Allow users to track performance, rank up a leaderboard, compete for prizes, earn emblems/badges.
