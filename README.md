Goals:
-
- Build internal automated systems to extract betting lines from a wide array of traditional sportsbooks and pickem/dfs sites for 
every market and league available, I will never pay for an API to get betting lines like most other
sports betting tools do.
- Train an ML model to learn complex patterns using features within the domain of a top-down strategy (finding
the bookmakers who have the sharpest odds, historical line movement, etc.), which results in
calculating an "expected value" for each betting line. 
- Create an engaging, attention-grasping, attractive user-interface that enables even the most
casual bettor to understand and enjoy gaining an edge over all bookmakers.
- Allow users to track performance, rank up a leaderboard, compete for prizes, earn emblems/badges.
BE KNOWN AS A COMPETITIVE PLATFORM.
- DFS or "social betting" is a rapidly expanding sub-sector of sports betting, that allows people
aged 18-20 to bet on sports. Traditional sportsbooks are not allowed to do this. I want to capitalize
on that age range (college students), by capturing value across dfs/social bookmakers that
other sports betting tools don't focus on, providing my app at an incredibly more affordable
price, relative to the value gained in return, than the market average (impart because my methods
of data collection will not come from an API).

Design:
-
- Leaderboards:
  - Should feel like "Clash Royale"
- Value Board:
  - Should feel like "Leetcode/Oddsjam"
- Theme Song:
  - Should feel like "Wolf of Wall Street Humming"
